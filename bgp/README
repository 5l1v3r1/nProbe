BGP lister written in perl: your BGP-enabled router connects to it, and it injects in a local
nProbe instance all the routes (initially all received routes, later all the routing updates)
so that the probe can compute the AS path and put it into emitted flows.

You can start this script from the nProbe BGP plugin part of nProbe Pro


NOTE that you need to configure into the source code your AS info
